Checklist:
 - Check title - in paper AND on arxiv.
 - Check author names and affiliation. Check spellings.
 - Remove comments from all sections (use remove_comments.py)
 - Remove all unused figures (use remove_unused_figures.py). This is optional since nowadays arxiv scans and removes all unused files (figures and tex files)
 - Ensure that the conference you submitted to is not visible anywhere (check footnotes, header etc.)
 - Copy paste all your errors into claude and ensure that none of them will cause a problem for the arxiv upload
 - Ask the meaning of all the errors
 - take a look at every figure and make sure it is aligned
 - Get .bbl file from output logs and cached file
 - Include the .bbl in the zip and ensure the name matches the main .tex file
